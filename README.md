# Intertext File merger

- Upload the intertext files you want to merge in the "data/input" folder within the repository.

- To upload, you need to write a commit message. i.e: Merge [dmk-t341-t0202-01-padma-20221217.bo.cn.xml,dmk-t341-t0202-03-JC-20221217.bo.cn.xml] into [dmk-t341-t0202.bo.cn.xml]. In commit message, you have to only write the names of alignment files that need to be merged.

- Once the files are uploaded and pushed, the merged file(s) will be located in the "data/output" folder within the repository and it will also create a folder
  "split_dmk-t341-t0202" in that same folder in which all the input intertext files are saved.
